# Advent of Code 2023

This repository has my solutions for this year's Advent of Code challenges. Each day's challenge will be placed into a directory named `day_N`, where `N` is the day of the challenge. Each day will have a solution program named `solution.*` (with the filetype depending on which programming language I used).

- For D programs, you can simply run them with `rdmd solution.d`.
- For Lua programs, you can run them with `lua solution.lua`.

Note that I try and solve the problems as fast as possible, but then I go back and clean up my solution, so what you see isn't really my ugly first attempt.
